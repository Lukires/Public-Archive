\sings{1. vers}Baby look at me
I'll be the last you see
you ain't seen the best of me yet
give me time 
I'll make you forget to rest
you can't run and hide
now I will set you free
you should not turn your back at me
don't you know what I can?

(cos') I'm playing Quake

\sings{Omkvæd}
\textbf{kor:} Quake!!!
I'm gonna play forever
I gotta learn not to die
\textbf{kor:} Aiii
I feel it coming together
People will see me and fry
\textbf{kor:} Quake!!!
I'm gonna send you to heaven
Ride my grenade like a witch
I'm gonna frag you forever
DIE, you old son of a bitch

Quad damage Quad damage
Quad damage Quad damage
Quad damage Quad damage
Quad damage Quad damage

\emph{2.  vers}
There're campers all around
Then I hear that jumpy sound
Turn around and fill him with lead
He screams, he falls, he looses his head.
And so for an hour at least
I am a killing beast
Every thing turns out just as planned
Your life's in my hand

cos I'm playing Quake
